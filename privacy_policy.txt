PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: November 26, 2025

================================================================================

1. INTRODUCTION

This Privacy Policy describes how Generalized Covariance Matrix ("we", "our",
or "the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your
privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

================================================================================

2. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

2.1 Local Processing

Generalized Covariance Matrix is designed as a local application that runs
entirely on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal
information on external servers.

2.2 Data We Do Not Collect

We do not collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, address, phone number)
- Location data
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Device information
- Cookies or tracking data

================================================================================

3. LOCAL DATA STORAGE

3.1 Temporary Files

The App may create temporary files on your local device during operation,
including:
- Computed results and visualizations
- Image processing outputs
- Analysis session data

These files are stored locally in your user directory (e.g., .random_matrix
folder) and remain entirely under your control.

3.2 User-Generated Content

Any images, data, or files you import or process within the App remain on
your local device. You have complete control over these files and can delete
them at any time.

================================================================================

4. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or
tracking services. All computations and processing occur locally on your
device.
================================================================================

5. DATA SECURITY

Since all data processing occurs locally on your device, the security of
your data depends on:
- Your device's security settings and protections
- Your operating system's file permissions
- Your local backup and security practices

We recommend following standard security best practices for your device and
operating system.

================================================================================

6. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the
age of 13. The App is designed for research, education, and professional use
in mathematical analysis and signal processing.

================================================================================

7. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. We
encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

================================================================================

8. DATA DELETION

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete any data
created by the App at any time by:
- Using the App's built-in folder management features
- Manually deleting files from your local storage
- Uninstalling the App

================================================================================

9. OPEN SOURCE

This application is open source. You can review the source code to verify
our privacy practices at our GitHub repository.

================================================================================

10. YOUR RIGHTS

Since we do not collect or store any personal data on external servers,
traditional data rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability) are
not applicable. All your data remains under your complete control on your
local device.
